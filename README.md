# inRiverCommunity Extensions Project

This project contains code to ease working with iPMC Extensions.


## Getting Started

Download the [``inRiverCommunity.Extensions.Core``](https://www.nuget.org/packages/inRiverCommunity.Extensions.Core) nuget package.


## Working with extension settings using classes

Parsing and working with the extension ``Context.Settings`` is sometimes a lot of work, to make the lives easier for the developers we have create the ability to declare a C# class with properties for your extensions settings, that are then parsed and easier to work with that the ``Context.Settings`` dictionary.

Take a look at the [``MySampleExtension.cs``](https://github.com/inRiverCommunity/Extensions/blob/master/Samples/inRiverCommunity.Extensions.ExtensionSettingsSample/MySampleExtension.cs) in the [ExtensionSettingsSample](https://github.com/inRiverCommunity/Extensions/tree/master/Samples/inRiverCommunity.Extensions.ExtensionSettingsSample) project to get a clearer picture of the capabilities and how to use the `ExtensionSettings` class and it's methods.
